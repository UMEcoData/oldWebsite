      <h2>What We Do:</h2>
      <br>
    </div>
    <p>Project Ideas can range from entirely technical pursuits, such as the development of a website to track migration patterns, to more active pursuits, such as collecting data on fluctuating ph levels in the Huron River. As these projects are inherently multidisciplinary, there is no prior experience needed at all to join, whether you are a EEB, Computer Science, or Econ major, all disciplines bring in perspectives and information that are valuable to projects. <!-- Current project teams include the development of a Ecological footprint app and a system to identify trash in Coral Reefs. -->
    <br><br>
    Michigan Eco Data will also plan entire club projects as well as fun group trips to exciting destinations or to aid with experimentation. Speakers and seminars will definitely be pursued in the future as great way to explore the wonderful world of Eco Data! Our primary goal in starting this club was to build a collaborative community of students who share the passion and interest in the environment, technology, and data! This is a community where no ideas are too crazy and where we will all learn and explore without the stress and pressure of exams and hw. To build this community we have many social events planned throughout the semester such as bonding events, game nights, parties, etc. Students can join the club at any point during the semester, just send an email to MichiganEcoData@umich.edu to be added to the mailing list.
